	abstract = {With the rapid development of modern logistics systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle (a.k.a. drone) based delivery service emerges as a technology-driven innovation, and it is now pilot running in many regions across the globe. The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current labor-intensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.},

	abstract = {The use of drones in urban logistics is gaining more and more interest. In this paper we consider the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, where some customers require a delivery and they can be served either by a truck or by a drone. The aim is minimizing the total time required to service all the customers. We present a branch and bound algorithm especially designed to efficiently target small instances up to 15 customers and a heuristic algorithm, using the branch and bound as a subroutine, to attack larger instances. Extensive experimental results suggest the effectiveness of the exact solver for small instances and shows that the heuristic is able to provide state-of-the-art results for medium/large instances.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research done on facility location problems under uncertainty in a humanitarian context. The major goal is to summarize and help structuring this topic, which has increasingly attracted the attention of the scientific community. The literature is reviewed from different perspectives namely, in terms of the type of facilities involved, the decisions to make, the criteria to optimize, the paradigm used for capturing uncertainty, and the solution method adopted. The detailed analysis provided in the manuscript also contributes to identifying the distinguishing features of the problems in the topic. An outcome of the state-of-the-art presented is the identification of the current research trends, expectations and holes in the existing knowledge thus highlighting relevant research directions.},
