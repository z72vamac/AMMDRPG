	abstract = {This paper addresses the optimization of routing problems with drones. It analyzes the coordination of one mothership with one drone to obtain optimal routes that have to visit some target objects modeled as general graphs. The goal is to minimize the overall weighted distance traveled by both vehicles while satisfying the requirements in terms of percentages of visits to targets. We discuss different approaches depending on the assumption made on the route followed by the mothership: i) the mothership can move on a continuous framework (the Euclidean plane), ii) on a connected piecewise linear polygonal chain or iii) on a general graph. In all cases, we develop exact formulations resorting to mixed integer second order cone programs that are compared on a testbed of instances to assess their performance. The high complexity of the exact methods makes it difficult to find optimal solutions in short computing time. For that reason, besides the exact formulations we also provide a tailored matheuristic algorithm that allows one to obtain high quality solutions in reasonable time. Computational experiments show the usefulness of our methods in different scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this paper we address the Length Constrained K-Drones Rural Postman Problem (LC K-DRPP). This is a continuous optimization problem where a fleet of homogeneous drones have to jointly service (traverse) a set of (curved or straight) lines of a network. Unlike the vehicles in classical arc routing problems, a drone can enter a line through any of its points, service a portion of that line, exit through another of its points, then travel directly to any point on another line, and so on. Moreover, since the range of the drones is restricted, the length of each route is limited by a maximum distance. Some applications for drone arc routing problems include inspection of pipelines, railway or power transmission lines and traffic monitoring. To deal with this problem, LC K-DRPP instances are digitized by approximating each line by a polygonal chain with a finite number of points and allowing drones to enter and exit each line only at these points. In this way we obtain an instance of the Length Constrained K-vehicles Rural Postman Problem (LC K-RPP). If the number of points used to discretize the lines is large, the LC K-RPP instance can be extremely large and, hence, very difficult to solve optimally. Even heuristic algorithms can fail in providing feasible solutions in reasonable computing times. An alternative is to generate smaller LC K-RPP instances by approximating each line with few but “significant” segments. We present a formulation and some valid inequalities for the LC K-RPP. Based on this, we have designed and implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution. Moreover, in order to be capable of providing good solutions for large LC K-RPP instances, we propose a matheuristic algorithm that begins by finding good solutions for the LC K-RPP instance obtained by approximating each line by a single segment. Then, to find better solutions, some promising intermediate points are sequentially incorporated. Extensive computational experiments to assess the performance of both algorithms are performed on several sets of instances from the literature.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present some drone arc routing problems (Drone ARPs) and study their relation with well-known postman ARPs. Applications for Drone ARPs include traffic monitoring by flying over roadways, infrastructure inspection such as by flying along power transmission lines, pipelines or fences, and surveillance along linear features such as coastlines or territorial borders. Unlike the postmen in traditional ARPs, drones can travel directly between any two points in the plane without following the edges of the network. As a consequence, a drone route may service only part of an edge, with multiple routes being used to cover the entire edge. Thus the Drone ARPs are continuous optimization problems with an infinite number of feasible solutions. In order to solve them as a discrete optimization problem, we approximate each curve in the plane by a polygonal chain, thus allowing the vehicle to enter and leave each curve only at the points of the polygonal chain. If the endurance of the vehicles is unlimited, the resulting problem is a rural postman problem (RPP). We propose an algorithm that iteratively solves RPP instances with an increasing number of points of the polygonal chain and present results on several sets of instances. We also briefly discuss the case in which the drones have limited endurance and several drones are needed.},

We then target the minimization of the installation costs for the considered UAV-based cellular architecture, by taking into account the constraints of UAVs coverage, SPs energy consumption, levels of the batteries and the deployment of the optical ring. After providing the problem formulation, we derive an innovative methodology to ensure that a single ring of installed optical fibers is deployed. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm, called DIARIZE, to practically tackle the problem. Our results, obtained over a set of representative rural scenarios, show that DIARIZE performs very close to the optimal solution, and in general outperforms a reference design based on fixed BSs.},

In this paper, we target the problem of maximizing the throughput over a set of areas in a disaster-affected territory. More in depth, we take into account: i) the limited endurance of the UAV-SC battery, ii) the maximum throughput that can be managed by each UAV-SC (due to backhauling/processing constraints), iii) the number of UAV-SCs that can simultaneously cover the same area. We then formulate the Maximum Throughput with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MT-UAV) problem, which is able to schedule the UAV-SC missions over a set of Time Slots (TSs) to maximize the total area throughput. Results, obtained over a realistic scenario, reveal that the total throughput is clearly impacted by the UAV-SC backhauling/processing constraints, rather than by the number of UAV-SCs providing coverage over the same area. Moreover, we analyze the UAV-SC missions selected by MT-UAV, showing that a typical mission is performed over multiple consecutive TSs. Therefore, we claim that the UAV-SC battery endurance is fundamental to guarantee sufficiently long missions and consequently to ensure the throughput requirements over multiple TSs.},

	abstract = {Given the rapid advances in unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, and increasing need to monitor at a city level, one of the current research gaps is how to systematically deploy drones over multiple periods. We propose a real-time data-driven approach: we formulate the first deterministic arc-inventory routing problem and derive its stochastic dynamic policy. The policy is expected to be of greatest value in scenarios where uncertainty is highest and costliest, such as city monitoring during major events. The Bellman equation for an approximation of the proposed inventory routing policy is formulated as a selective vehicle routing problem. We propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based on Least Squares Monte Carlo simulation to find that policy. The algorithm has been modified so that the least squares dependent variable is defined to be the “expected stock out cost upon the next replenishment”. The new algorithm is tested on 30 simulated instances of real time trajectories over 5 time periods of the selective vehicle routing problem to evaluate the proposed policy and algorithm. Computational results on the selected instances show that the algorithm on average outperforms the myopic policy by 23–28\%, depending on the parametric design. Further tests are conducted on classic benchmark arc routing problem instances. The 11-link instance gdb19 (Golden et al., 1983) is expanded into a sequential 15-period stochastic dynamic example and used to demonstrate why a naïve static multi-period deployment plan would not be effective in real networks.},

We consider the specific situation of a delivery company, that uses a set of trucks equipped with a given number of drones. In particular, items of a limited weight and size could be delivered by using drones. A vehicle, during its trip, can launch a drone when serving a customer, the drone performs a delivery for exactly one customer and returns to the vehicle, possibly at a different customer location. Each drone can be launched several times during the vehicle's route. It is imposed a limit on the maximum distance that each drone can travel and synchronization requirements between vehicle and drone should be ensured. In particular, it is assumed that a vehicle waits for a drone for a maximum period of time. The aim is to serve all customers within their time window. The problem is modeled as a variant of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The aim of this work is to analyze the delivery process with drones, by taking into account the total transportation cost and highlighting strategical issues, related to the use of drones. The numerical results, collected on instances generated to be very close to reality, show that the use of drones is not economically convenient in the classical terms. However, when considering negative externalities related to the use of classical vehicles and quality of service requirements, the benefit of using drones becomes relevant.},

Classical open-loop spiral or lawn-mower patterns typically cannot represent large sub-regions that are unlikely to contain an object of interest that are thus waste- fully covered. More general algorithms can maintain arbitrary likelihood distributions but fundamentally solve a complex continuous-space trajectory optimization problem, requiring a trade-off between look-ahead and computational complexity while providing at best asymptotic coverage guarantees. This paper considers generating global coverage patterns in the space of the coverage area, with specific focus on road networks, and mapping these to UAV actions. A new method is proposed for producing and following such patterns with dynamics-constrained vehicles, compared with existing coverage strategies, and shown to be advantageous in many realistic environments through simulations of real-world aircraft. Results suggest environment density as a metric for algorithm selection given a lack of dominance by any one strategy across all environments.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of implementing unmanned aerial delivery vehicles in delivery networks. We investigate the notion of the reduced overall delivery time, energy, and costs for a truck-drone network by comparing the in-tandem system with a stand-alone delivery effort. The objectives are (1) to investigate the time, energy, and costs associated to a truck-drone delivery network compared to standalone truck or drone, (2) to propose an optimization algorithm that determines the optimal number of launch sites and locations given delivery requirements, and drones per truck, (3) to develop mathematical formulations for closed form estimations for the optimal number of launch locations, optimal total time, as well as the associated cost for the system. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the algorithm herein computes the minimal time of delivery utilizing K-means clustering to find launch locations, as well as a genetic algorithm to solve the truck route as a traveling salesmen problem (TSP). The optimal solution is determined by finding the minimum cost associated to the parabolic convex cost function. The optimal min-cost is determined by finding the most efficient launch locations using K-means algorithms to determine launch locations and a genetic algorithm to determine truck route between those launch locations. Findings: Results show improvements with in-tandem delivery efforts as opposed to standalone systems. Further, multiple drones per truck are more optimal and contribute to savings in both energy and time. For this, we sampled various initialization variables to derive closed form mathematical solutions for the problem. originality/value: Ultimately, this provides the necessary analysis of an integrated truck-drone delivery system which could be implemented by a company in order to maximize deliveries while minimizing time and energy. Closed-form mathematical solutions can be used as close estimators for final costs and time.},

For this, a multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack problem is formulated to find an optimal solution minimising flight time and then solved via mixed integer linear programming.

In particular, a circular-circular-circular type of the Dubins path is exploited based on a differential geometry to guarantee that the vehicles follow the road precisely in a densely distributed road environment. Moreover, to overcome the computational burden of the multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack algorithm, a nearest insertion and auction-based approximation algorithm is newly introduced.

The Dubins path planning produces the shortest and flyable paths in consideration of physical constraints, so that the Dubins path is used to calculate the cost function of the modified search problem. The performance of the proposed multiple UAVs road network search algorithm is verified via numerical simulation for a given map.},

Each drone is capable of launching from the truck with one or more packages to deliver to customers. Each drone may return to the truck to swap/recharge batteries, pick up a new set of packages, and launch again to customer locations. Unlike many papers in the current literature, the model not only allows for a drone to carry multiple heterogeneous packages but also allows the specification of a drone energy drain function that takes into account each package weight, and it decouples the set of launch locations from the set of customer locations. This paper proposes a flexible heuristic solution. Computational experiments and sensitivity analyses are also conducted using physical parameters for drones that are consistent with recent research.},

	abstract = {In this paper we deal with an extension of the crossing postman problem to design Hamiltonian routes that have to visit different shapes of dimensional elements (neighborhoods or polygonal chains) rather than edges. This problem models routes of drones that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next target element using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of actual characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second one are not referenced to the stages of the route. We compare them on a testbed of randomly generated instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone representable (SOC) and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational result reported in this paper show that our models are useful and can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems with neighborhoods. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and VNS. This algorithm performs very well in quality of solutions provided and can be used to initialize the exact methods with promising initial solutions.},

	abstract = {We study two new informative path planning problems that are motivated by the use of aerial and ground robots in precision agriculture. The first problem, termed sampling traveling salesperson problem with neighborhoods (Sampling TSPN), is motivated by scenarios in which unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are used to obtain time-consuming soil measurements. The input in SamplingTSPN is a set of possibly overlapping disks. The objective is to choose a sampling location in each disk and a tour to visit the set of sampling locations so as to minimize the sum of the travel and measurement times. The second problem concerns obtaining the maximum number of aerial measurements using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with limited energy. We study the scenario in which the two types of robots form a symbiotic system - the UAV lands on the UGV, and the UGV transports the UAV between deployment locations. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we present an O(rmax/rmin) approximation algorithm for SamplingTSPN, where rmin and rmax are the minimum and maximum radii of input disks. Second, we show how to model the UAV planning problem using a metric graph and formulate an orienteering instance to which a known approximation algorithm can be applied. Third, we apply the two algorithms to the problem of obtaining ground and aerial measurements in order to accurately estimate a nitrogen map of a plot. Along with theoretical results, we present results from simulations conducted using real soil data and preliminary field experiments with the UAV.},

Our approach is systems-driven, relying on experimental studies to identify the permissible number of hops for multi-UAV video relaying in a noisy 3-D environment. Our architecture itself is innovative in the sense that it defines a mathematical framework for selecting the UAVs for periodic re-charging by landing on public transportation buses, and then 'riding' the bus to the successive chosen Pol. Specifically, we show that our UAV scheduler can be modeled as an instance of multicommodity flow problems, and mathematically solved through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. Thus, our centralized formulation identifies the UAV, the next bus, and the next PoI, given the information about energy thresholds, the bus routes in the city and their next arrival times, to ensure persistent and reliable video coverage of all PoIs in the city. Finally, our work is validated via emulation of a city environment with live traffic updates from a real bus transportation network.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in many industries. In the medical environment, especially in some emergency situations, UAVs play an important role such as the supply of medicines and blood with speed and efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-objective blood supply by UAVs in such emergency situations. This is a complex problem that includes maintenance of the supply blood's temperature model during transportation, the UAVs' scheduling and routes' planning in case of multiple sites requesting blood, and limited carrying endurance. Most importantly, we need to study the blood's temperature change due to the external environment, the heating agent (or refrigerant) and time factor during transportation, and propose an optimal method for calculating the mixing proportion of blood and appendage in different circumstances and delivery conditions. Then, by introducing the idea of transportation appendage into the traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), this new problem is proposed according to the factors of distance and weight. Algorithmically, we use the combination of decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and local search method to perform a series of experiments on the CVRP public dataset. By comparing our technique with the traditional ones, our algorithm can obtain better optimization results and time performance.},

	abstract = {Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance.},

To this end, we present a dynamic vehicle routing problem with heterogeneous fleets. Customers order goods over the course of the day. These goods are delivered either by a drone or by a regular transportation vehicle within a delivery deadline. Drones are faster, but have a limited endurance as well as require charging after use. In the same-day context, vehicle endurance is not a constraint, but vehicles are slow due to urban traffic. To decide whether an order is delivered by a drone or by a vehicle, we present a policy function approximation based on geographical districting. Our computational study reveals two major implications. First, geographical districting is highly effective increasing the expected number of same-day deliveries. Second, a combination of drone and vehicle fleets may significantly reduce the required delivery resources.},

The larger vehicle, which may be a ship or an airplane, is called the mothership; the smaller vehicle, which may be a small boat or unmanned aerial vehicle, is called the drone. We assume that there exists a set of target locations T. For each t in T, the drone must launch from the mothership, visit t, and then return to the mothership to refuel. The drone has a limited range of R time units. In the MDRP, we assume that both mothership and drone operate in the âopen seasâ (i.e., using the Euclidean metric). We also introduce the mothership and infinite-endurance drone routing problem (MDRP-IC), where a drone launches from the mothership and visits one or more targets consecutively before returning to the mothership. Our exact approach uses branch and bound, where each node of the branch-and-bound tree corresponds to a potential subsequence of the order of target visits. A lower bound at each node is given by solving a second-order cone program, which optimally chooses a launch point and landing point for each target in the subsequence. A set of heuristics that also uses a second-order cone program as an embedded procedure is presented. We show that our schemes are flexible to accommodate a variety of additional constraints and/or objective functions. Computational results and interesting variants of the MDRP and MDRP-IC are also presented.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of modern logistics systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle (a.k.a. drone) based delivery service emerges as a technology-driven innovation, and it is now pilot running in many regions across the globe. The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current labor-intensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.},
