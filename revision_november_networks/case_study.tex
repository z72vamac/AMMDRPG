\section{Case Study\label{section:CS}}

\noindent
In this section\CV{,} we describe a realistic application of the system studied in this paper to perform surveillance operations. Considering the current COVID-19 restrictions, we focus on the problem of preventing and identifying possible concentrations of people during events such as popular or religious festivals. In particular\CV{,} we consider the Courtyards Festival of Cordoba (\url{https://patios.cordoba.es/es/}). This is a social event that takes place every year in the city of Cordoba, Spain, during the first two weeks of May. Courtyardâ€™s owners decorate their houses with many flowers trying to win the award that is offered by the Town Hall. During this competition\CV{,} a festival runs in parallel with a number of artistic performances along six different paths located in different areas in the city as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mapPF}.
In the pandemic context, to monitor the situation to avoid \CV{the} concentration of people, we propose to apply a system consisting of one helicopter and a fleet of three drones.
This kind of system has been proved successfully and has been already applied in the military field by the US Army (in order to) \CV{to} leave the helicopter (to) \CV{at} the edge of dangerous airspace and release drones, which will then penetrate \CV{the} enemy territory and send back intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information (see \cite{FG}).
In our application\CV{,} the reason to adopt a similar system is the possibility to inspect simultaneously and in real time different paths\CV{,} also reducing the risk of flying the helicopter over populated areas and the cost (for) \CV{of} moving the helicopter by minimizing the total length of its tour.

We run the model presented in Section \ref{Form} on this scenario starting from the initial solution provided by the matheuristic, where the 6 coloured paths reported in the map of Figure \ref{fig:mapPF} represent the 6 target graphs to be visited, in this case inspected, by the fleet of drones. In addition, we suppose that the drones' speed is \LA{43} km/h while that of the helicopter is  \LA{30} km/h aiming to minimize costs.
Moreover, we assume that the fleet is composed by \LA{two} drones with an endurance equal to \LA{30 minutes}, and we impose that each target graph must be fully visited (inspected).  As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:Mtour}, the origin of the mothership tour coincides with the destination and it is located in an area of the city where it is possible to assume the take-off and landing of an helicopter. Figure \ref{fig:Mtour} reports the tour followed by the helicopter \CV{with} (in) the solution obtained within the time limit of 2 hours \CV{set(s)} to solve the model and with a percentage gap equal to 83\%. We can observe that the helicopter, starting from the origin, flies to the point $x_L^1$ that is the first launching point and then flies along the edge connecting $x_L^1$ with $x_R^1$, that is the first rendezvous point. Next, the helicopter flies to $x_L^2$ for launching the second drones' mission that are retrieved at point $x_R^2$. The third and last mission starts from $x_L^3$ and ends at point $x_R^3$ from where the helicopter goes back to the final destination.\\
Figure \ref{fig:tourD} shows the tour followed by the three drones for inspecting the six paths. In particular, one drone, in red, starts from $x_L^1$ for visiting the path of "Alcazar Viejo". From the same point\CV{,} a second drone, in green, starts for visiting the path of "Santa Maria-San Agustin". Both drones end their first mission at point $x_R^1$, where they are retrieved by the helicopter. Then, the helicopter flies to point $x_L^2$ where only one drone, the red one, starts its second mission to visit the path of "Juderia-San Francisco". In the meanwhile\CV{,} the helicopter, containing the other two drones, flies to point $x_R^2$ where it retrieves the previously launched drone. The last mission involves all the three drones that are launched from point $x_L^3$. The first drone, the red one, visits the path of "San Lorenzo", the second, the green one, visits the path of "Regina-Realejo" and the third, the blue one, visits the path of "Santiago-San Pedro".
All the three drones are retrieved by the helicopter at point $x_R^3$ and after that the helicopter goes back to the destination. 
The total distance travelled by the helicopter is equal to 11.27 km.
