   abstract = {In this article, we present some drone arc routing problems (Drone ARPs) and study their relation with well-known postman ARPs. Applications for Drone ARPs include traffic monitoring by flying over roadways, infrastructure inspection such as by flying along power transmission lines, pipelines or fences, and surveillance along linear features such as coastlines or territorial borders. Unlike the postmen in traditional ARPs, drones can travel directly between any two points in the plane without following the edges of the network. As a consequence, a drone route may service only part of an edge, with multiple routes being used to cover the entire edge. Thus the Drone ARPs are continuous optimization problems with an infinite number of feasible solutions. In order to solve them as a discrete optimization problem, we approximate each curve in the plane by a polygonal chain, thus allowing the vehicle to enter and leave each curve only at the points of the polygonal chain. If the endurance of the vehicles is unlimited, the resulting problem is a rural postman problem (RPP). We propose an algorithm that iteratively solves RPP instances with an increasing number of points of the polygonal chain and present results on several sets of instances. We also briefly discuss the case in which the drones have limited endurance and several drones are needed.},

   abstract = {In a near future drones are likely to become a viable way of dis- tributing parcels in a urban environment. In this paper we consider the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem, where a set of customers requir- ing a delivery is split between a truck and a fleet of drones, with the aim of minimizing the total time required to service all the customers. We present a set of matheuristic methods for the problem. The new ap- proaches are validated via an experimental campaign on two sets of bench- marks available in the literature. It is shown that the approaches we propose perform very well on small/medium size instances. Solving a mixed integer linear programming model to optimality leads to the first optimality proof for all the instances with 20 customers considered, while the heuristics are shown to be fast and effective on the same dataset. When considering larger instances with 48 to 229 customers, the results are competitive with state- of-the-art methods and lead to 28 new best known solutions out of the 90 instances considered.},

   abstract = {We study two new informative path planning problems that are motivated by the use of aerial and ground robots in precision agriculture. The first problem, termed sampling traveling salesperson problem with neighborhoods (Sampling TSPN), is motivated by scenarios in which unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are used to obtain time-consuming soil measurements. The input in SamplingTSPN is a set of possibly overlapping disks. The objective is to choose a sampling location in each disk and a tour to visit the set of sampling locations so as to minimize the sum of the travel and measurement times. The second problem concerns obtaining the maximum number of aerial measurements using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with limited energy. We study the scenario in which the two types of robots form a symbiotic system - the UAV lands on the UGV, and the UGV transports the UAV between deployment locations. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we present an O(rmax/rmin) approximation algorithm for SamplingTSPN, where rmin and rmax are the minimum and maximum radii of input disks. Second, we show how to model the UAV planning problem using a metric graph and formulate an orienteering instance to which a known approximation algorithm can be applied. Third, we apply the two algorithms to the problem of obtaining ground and aerial measurements in order to accurately estimate a nitrogen map of a plot. Along with theoretical results, we present results from simulations conducted using real soil data and preliminary field experiments with the UAV.},

   abstract = {Given the rapid advances in unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, and increasing need to monitor at a city level, one of the current research gaps is how to systematically deploy drones over multiple periods. We propose a real-time data-driven approach: we formulate the first deterministic arc-inventory routing problem and derive its stochastic dynamic policy. The policy is expected to be of greatest value in scenarios where uncertainty is highest and costliest, such as city monitoring during major events. The Bellman equation for an approximation of the proposed inventory routing policy is formulated as a selective vehicle routing problem. We propose an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based on Least Squares Monte Carlo simulation to find that policy. The algorithm has been modified so that the least squares dependent variable is defined to be the “expected stock out cost upon the next replenishment”. The new algorithm is tested on 30 simulated instances of real time trajectories over 5 time periods of the selective vehicle routing problem to evaluate the proposed policy and algorithm. Computational results on the selected instances show that the algorithm on average outperforms the myopic policy by 23–28%, depending on the parametric design. Further tests are conducted on classic benchmark arc routing problem instances. The 11-link instance gdb19 (Golden et al., 1983) is expanded into a sequential 15-period stochastic dynamic example and used to demonstrate why a naïve static multi-period deployment plan would not be effective in real networks.},

In this paper, we target the problem of maximizing the throughput over a set of areas in a disaster-affected territory. More in depth, we take into account: i) the limited endurance of the UAV-SC battery, ii) the maximum throughput that can be managed by each UAV-SC (due to backhauling/processing constraints), iii) the number of UAV-SCs that can simultaneously cover the same area. We then formulate the Maximum Throughput with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MT-UAV) problem, which is able to schedule the UAV-SC missions over a set of Time Slots (TSs) to maximize the total area throughput. Results, obtained over a realistic scenario, reveal that the total throughput is clearly impacted by the UAV-SC backhauling/processing constraints, rather than by the number of UAV-SCs providing coverage over the same area. Moreover, we analyze the UAV-SC missions selected by MT-UAV, showing that a typical mission is performed over multiple consecutive TSs. Therefore, we claim that the UAV-SC battery endurance is fundamental to guarantee sufficiently long missions and consequently to ensure the throughput requirements over multiple TSs.},

In the medical environment, especially in some emergency situations, UAVs play an important role such as the supply of medicines and blood with speed and efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-objective blood supply by UAVs in such emergency situations. This is a complex problem that includes maintenance of the supply blood's temperature model during transportation, the UAVs' scheduling and routes' planning in case of multiple sites requesting blood, and limited carrying endurance. Most importantly, we need to study the blood's temperature change due to the external environment, the heating agent (or refrigerant) and time factor during transportation, and propose an optimal method for calculating the mixing proportion of blood and appendage in different circumstances and delivery conditions. Then, by introducing the idea of transportation appendage into the traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), this new problem is proposed according to the factors of distance and weight. Algorithmically, we use the combination of decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and local search method to perform a series of experiments on the CVRP public dataset. By comparing our technique with the traditional ones, our algorithm can obtain better optimization results and time performance.},

Our approach is systems-driven, relying on experimental studies to identify the permissible number of hops for multi-UAV video relaying in a noisy 3-D environment. Our architecture itself is innovative in the sense that it defines a mathematical framework for selecting the UAVs for periodic re-charging by landing on public transportation buses, and then 'riding' the bus to the successive chosen Pol. Specifically, we show that our UAV scheduler can be modeled as an instance of multicommodity flow problems, and mathematically solved through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. Thus, our centralized formulation identifies the UAV, the next bus, and the next PoI, given the information about energy thresholds, the bus routes in the city and their next arrival times, to ensure persistent and reliable video coverage of all PoIs in the city. Finally, our work is validated via emulation of a city environment with live traffic updates from a real bus transportation network.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a road-network search route planning algorithm by which multiple autonomous vehicles are able to efficiently visit every road identified in the map in the context of the Chinese postman problem. Since the typical Chinese postman algorithm can be applied solely to a connected road-network in which ground vehicles are involved, it is modified to be used for a general type of road map including unconnected roads as well as the operational and physical constraints of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For this, a multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack problem is formulated to find an optimal solution minimising flight time and then solved via mixed integer linear programming. To deal with the dynamic constraints of the UAVs, the Dubins theory is used for path generation. In particular, a circular-circular-circular type of the Dubins path is exploited based on a differential geometry to guarantee that the vehicles follow the road precisely in a densely distributed road environment. Moreover, to overcome the computational burden of the multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack algorithm, a nearest insertion and auction-based approximation algorithm is newly introduced. The properties and performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated via numerical simulations operating on a real village map and randomly generated maps with different parameters. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

Classical open-loop spiral or lawn-mower patterns typically cannot represent large sub-regions that are unlikely to contain an object of interest that are thus waste- fully covered. More general algorithms can maintain arbitrary likelihood distributions but fundamentally solve a complex continuous-space trajectory optimization problem, requiring a trade-off between look-ahead and computational complexity while providing at best asymptotic coverage guarantees. This paper considers generating global coverage patterns in the space of the coverage area, with specific focus on road networks, and mapping these to UAV actions. A new method is proposed for producing and following such patterns with dynamics-constrained vehicles, compared with existing coverage strategies, and shown to be advantageous in many realistic environments through simulations of real-world aircraft. Results suggest environment density as a metric for algorithm selection given a lack of dominance by any one strategy across all environments.},
